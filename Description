Project Description

This project is a simple yet effective Calculator application built with Python and Gradio. It allows users to perform the four basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—through an interactive and user-friendly web interface.

The calculator accepts two numeric inputs and lets users choose an operation via a radio button. Results are displayed instantly when the "Calculate" button is clicked. Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message instead of crashing the app, ensuring a smooth user experience.

The app is lightweight, easy to set up, and can run directly in Google Colab or locally on your machine with minimal configuration. By using Gradio, the project avoids the need for complex frontend development and offers a clean, responsive interface that works across devices.
